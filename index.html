                        Welcome to my site! Allow me to provide some context about myself. I was born in San Francisco, but spent a significant portion of my childhood in Shanghai, China, where I attended local schools. Upon returning to the United States, I pursued a degree in graphic design at the esteemed Rhode Island School of Design, which was widely regarded as the premier institution for this field at the time. During the pandemic, I opted to take a gap year to travel around the world and build up work experiences. I am now a senior, eagerly preparing to graduate and explore the professional world of technology and design.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My ultimate objective in the realm of art and design is to develop fresh, impactful creations that resonate with my audiences. This may involve designing a new tool or product that enhances individuals' lives, or crafting visually striking designs that leave a lasting impression. Initially, I focused on industrial design, but came to the realization that achieving my creative ambitions necessitated commencing from the basics and progressing upward. I shifted my focus to graphic design, immersing myself in image editing, typography, photography….all principles of form and shape. Presently, I have broadened my skillset to encompass elements of interaction, motion, and research to create effective marketing and user-centric designs.
