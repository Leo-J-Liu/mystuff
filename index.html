                    HelIo! Here’s a bit of background about myself. I was born in San Francisco, but I left the United States at a young age and went to China, where my mother is from. I spent 15 years of my life growing up in Shanghai, studying in local schools, and before high school I moved back to California. After Highschool I enrolled in Rhode Island School of Design, the best school at the time to pursue a degree in graphic design. I took a gap during covid and I am now a Senior ready to graduate.

                    My goal in pursuing art and design is to create something new, whether it is a new “thing” that allows people to do things better and easier or a “look” that makes people's eyes wide open. I was initially in Industrial design until I realized that to be able to achieve my goal I need to work myself from the most basics and up. So In graphic design I started with image editing, photography, typography, and the study of form and shape. I now move on to the field of digital media where I narrate an experience with interaction, motion, and sound. </p3>
